Stack and heap are two very important memory allocation areas in computer science and are usually taught during lectures.\nThe goal of my project was to take as a starting point an application that my thesis advisor (<a href=\"https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/hauswirth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prof. Matthias Hauswirth</a>) had built in the past and has been using during his Programming Fundamentals 2 course, and create a web application able to do the same things.\nMy application will be used during that course (instead of the old tool) starting from September 2020.",
